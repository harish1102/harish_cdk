To create a schema, users, groups, roles, and manage permissions in an Amazon Redshift database as specified, you need a series of SQL commands. These will define the required elements and set up the necessary access controls according to your requirements. Hereâ€™s how you can proceed:

Step 1: Create Schema
CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;

CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
CREATE USER user2 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
CREATE USER user3 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
CREATE USER user4 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Create groups
CREATE GROUP group_select;
CREATE GROUP group_all;

-- Add users to groups
ALTER GROUP group_select ADD USER user1;
ALTER GROUP group_select ADD USER user2;
ALTER GROUP group_all ADD USER user3;
ALTER GROUP group_all ADD USER user4;


-- Create roles
CREATE ROLE role_select;
CREATE ROLE role_all;

-- Grant privileges to roles
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA my_schema TO role_select;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA my_schema TO role_all;

-- To ensure future tables are also covered
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA my_schema GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO role_select;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA my_schema GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO role_all;


-- Grant roles to groups
GRANT role_select TO group_select;
GRANT role_all TO group_all;
